## Demo 4 - Azure Monitor

- Head to App Insights
  - Overview of key metrics
  - We can add these to a dashboard but we only want to be here if something has gone wrong
  - Check alerts and notice we have an alert raise for exception
  - Nav to failures and drill into exception
  - Explore the information we have in the exception
  - Create a new work item
  - Head back to Azure DevOps and view the work item
